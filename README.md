# musiCode
musiCode is an user-friendly music/project sharing platform created by developers for developers. musiCode gives its users the ability to search, listen to and even add songs to their own curated collection. Users also have the ability to create/view post from fellow developers. Each post will include the name of, a description of and the link to the project they choose to share. As well as a link to that users collection of music.

## Motivation
musiCode was born from a simple conversation between the creators about what music they like listening to while coding. They quickly found that they all used different music platforms and sharing songs with each other wouldn't be simple. Thus, the idea of music sharing for developers by developers became reality with the creation of musiCode.
